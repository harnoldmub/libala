## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite.
**UI Component System**: Shadcn/ui (based on Radix UI) with Tailwind CSS.
**Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing (`/`, `/login`, `/admin`, `/cagnotte`, `/contribution/merci`).
**State Management**: TanStack Query for server state.
**Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
**Styling System**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for light/dark modes and a gold/ivory palette.
**Typography**: Google Fonts (Playfair Display, Lato, Great Vibes).

### Backend Architecture

**Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js (TypeScript).
**API Design**: RESTful API for RSVP management, login, and user session.
**Authentication**: Local authentication using Passport-local with bcrypt and `express-session` (PostgreSQL-backed).
**Data Layer**: Storage abstraction with Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL.
**Development Server**: Vite with HMR.

### Data Storage

**Database**: PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless driver).
**ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries.
**Schema Design**: `sessions`, `users`, `rsvp_responses`, and `contributions` tables storing guest details, availability, table assignments, and wedding contributions.
**Type Safety**: Full type inference from database schema to TypeScript using Drizzle and Zod for runtime validation.

### UI/UX Decisions

The design is inspired by luxury wedding platforms, featuring a gold and ivory color palette.
- **Hero Section**: Large elegant names with a subtle background image.
- **Notre Histoire**: Separated portrait layout with a centered quote.
- **Dates Section**: Clean heading with a large date display and countdown timer.
- **Gallery**: 3-column grid with aspect-ratio 3:4 images and hover effects, including a lightbox and social sharing.
- **Footer**: Organized 4-column structure with navigation.
- **General**: Increased white space, light font weights, consistent `tracking-wide` and `uppercase` styling for section headers, and smooth scroll navigation.
